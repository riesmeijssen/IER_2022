# IER_2022

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository or directly download the `Data_IER_2022_Cleaned.xlsx` file.
2. Get the complete dataset by contacting the teachers of the ME41125 course of the Delft University of Technology. This will be in the form of a `.csv` file.
3. Copy column V, W and X of the complete dataset.
4. Paste the copied columns into column B, C and D of the `Data_IER_2022_Cleaned.xlsx` file.

All calculations should now automatically happen. Resulting figures can be seen if you scroll to the right in the excel sheet, as well as the means and variances.
